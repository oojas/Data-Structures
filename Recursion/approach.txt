Recursion is one of the trickiest topics in DSA.

We can imagine solving the problems in two ways.
1. Find a solution for a shorter problem and then call the func and the rest will be done.
Example : Sum of digits of a number.
 return n%10+sum(n/10);
 Here we are assuming that if we have the value of n-1 digits sum. So we compute the sum of nth number.
 This is the first approach . Divide the problem into smaller problems.

 2. Start building a recrusion tree and then solve the question.
 Example : Finding subsets.

 We draw theb recrusion tree with an empty string and use include/Not include method.
 We draw the recrusion tree and then find the solution.
 subsets(a,index+1,curr); // curr is an empty string
 subsets(a,index+1,curr+a.charAt(i));
