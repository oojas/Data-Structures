In Java there are two ways of implementation of stack
1. Using Stack class which inherits vector which inturn inherits list.
2. Using ArrayDeque class which inherits deque which again inherits queue.

Using stack as a class can give us overhead functioinality because the vector class uses additional features of multithreading.
So using ArrayDeque is a great option.
ArrayDeque has same functioinality as stack so we should use ArrayDeque.

example :
ArrayDeque<Integer> s=new ArrayDeque<Integer>();
s.push(12);
s.push(23);
s.pop(20);
s.peek(122);


It has same functions as stack .
