Dynamic Programming is a type of programming which reduces the exponential time complexity
of mainly recursive solutions by eliminating overlapping cases. 
Dynamic Programming becomes extremely useful with two types of methods:
1. Memoization : In Memoization we try to reduce overlapping cases in recursion by introducing array or maps
                 They particularly store values of some cases and when these cases are called again and again 
                 in the recursion then without computing the whole function they can be simply called as they
                 are already stored inside the array. The dimensions of the array depends on the parameters that
                 are changing.
                 It is a top-down approach.

2. Tabulation : In Tabulation we use the bottom up approach where we try to guess the solution of the ith or jth 
                interval by using i-1 and j-1 interval. They are difficult to implement but doesnt use recursion in 
                it. It is generally faster than the Memoization method as it doesnt have extra function calls.
